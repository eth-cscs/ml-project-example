# Alps technical training — Swiss AI Initiative Annual Meeting 2026

> ## ⚠️ Work in progress — draft
>
> This repository is being written for a session that has **not happened yet**
> (Wednesday 26 August 2026). Nothing here is final.
>
> - Modules 0 and 2 to 5 are **scaffolding**, not finished material. They were drafted
>   from `docs.cscs.ch` so that no module owner starts from a blank page. Their voice is
>   generic and several slides are marked `PLACEHOLDER`.
> - Slides carrying `TODO(verify)` contain claims that are **correct but not yet
>   traceable to public documentation** — there are 16 of them, listed in
>   [`notes/docs-gaps.md`](notes/docs-gaps.md).
> - Some figures come from a **documentation preview** that has not been merged into
>   `docs.cscs.ch` yet, and may change.
>
> Do not cite anything from this repository as CSCS guidance.
> [`docs.cscs.ch`](https://docs.cscs.ch) is the authority.

Material for the Alps technical training that CSCS delivers at the Swiss AI Initiative
Annual Meeting: 90 minutes, roughly 60 of presentation and 30 of open discussion, two
days before the [CSCS User Day](https://www.cscs.ch).

The session follows **one project** end to end — from "we need compute" to "the model is
trained and being served" — so that everyone leaves knowing *where the authoritative
documentation is* for the next step they personally have to take.

## Preview

The built deck is published from `main` on every push:

**→ [View the slides](https://candrea85.github.io/swiss-ai-day-2026-alps-tech-training/)**

Press `p` in the deck for presenter view: speaker notes, next slide and a timer.

## Modules

| # | Module | Budget | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Alps, the ML Platform, and the next hour | 5 min | TBD | scaffold |
| 1 | Project lifecycle and access | 14 min | **Andrea Ceriani** | on budget |
| 2 | Data and storage | 13 min | TBD | scaffold |
| 3 | A concrete ML use case | 30 min | Fawzi + owners per subsection | restructured, two subsections still placeholders |
| 4 | Where to go from here | 3 min | TBD | scaffold |
| — | Backup, shown on request | — | — | HPC Console block ready |

Budgets, hand-offs between modules and the pre-agreed cuts are in
[`notes/agenda.md`](notes/agenda.md).

## Building

Slides are Markdown compiled with [Marp](https://marp.app). One source, three outputs,
speaker notes carried into all of them.

```bash
make all        # PPTX, HTML and PDF
make pptx       # PowerPoint, notes in the speaker-notes pane
make html       # self-contained HTML, press "p" for presenter view
make pdf        # PDF, notes as annotations
make handout    # the one-page A4 cheat sheet
make runsheet   # timing sheet: when each module starts, what it cuts if late
make check      # slide count and speaking time against the 60-minute ceiling
make M=01 module   # build one module on its own, for rehearsal
```

Requires Node.js — `npx` fetches Marp — and a Chromium that Marp can drive.

## Working in this repository

Read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) first. It is the brief: language policy, content rules,
the slide style guide and the module budgets. Two rules matter more than the rest.

1. **Never invent CSCS facts.** Every path, quota, command, flag, hostname and role name
   must be traceable to `docs.cscs.ch` or to material someone provided. If you cannot
   verify it, write `<!-- TODO(verify): ... -->` and say so.
2. **Everything in this repository is in English** — slides, notes, handouts, commit
   messages, file names. Contributors may work in whatever language they prefer; that
   never changes what lands in the repository.

Own a module? Rewrite the scaffolding rather than defending it. It exists to save you
the blank page, not to constrain you.

## Layout

```
slides/            one Marp file per module, plus backup slides
slides/theme/      the shared CSCS theme
handout/           the one-page A4 cheat sheet and its theme
notes/             agenda, source provenance, documentation gaps
assets/            logos, and the list of screenshots still to capture
tools/             build helpers: assemble, inline assets, slide count, run sheet
build/             generated output, git-ignored, never edited by hand
```
