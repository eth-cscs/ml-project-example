# Data and storage

You have a shell and an empty home directory. Where do two terabytes of training data go?

<!--
START AT T+19:00. Check the presenter timer now.
CUT IF LATE: Cut "Inodes run out before terabytes do". Say it in one line over the mount-point table.

- You are in, with a shell on Clariden and an empty home directory.
- His first real question is where to put his data.
- Getting this wrong is the most expensive mistake on this platform.
- Wrong filesystem means slow training. Or deleted data.
- Next: There are four places, and they are not interchangeable.

# Six mount points, and they are not interchangeable

Putting data in the wrong one is the most common and most expensive mistake here.

| | Path | For | Cleanup |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Home** | `/users/$USER` | code, scripts, config — 50 GB | none |
| **Scratch** `iopsstor` | `/iopsstor/scratch/cscs/$USER` | training data, random I/O | **14 days** |
| **Scratch** `capstor` | `/capstor/scratch/cscs/$USER` | checkpoints, sequential I/O | **30 days** |
| **Scratch** `ritom` | `/ritom/scratch/cscs/$USER` | VAST — parallel, shared-file I/O | **30 days** |
| **Project store** | `/capstor/store/cscs/swissai/<project>` | shared, medium term, backed up | none |
| **Project** `datacache` | `/iopsstor/datacache/cscs/swissai/<project>` | shared fast datasets — **on request** | none |

<div class="accent">

**Scratch** is per user and is **not** backed up. **Store** is per project and **is** backed up.

</div>

<!--
- Six mount points. Read the table, do not read it out loud.
- Three groups. Home, scratch, and project.
- Home is small. 50 gigabytes. Code and configuration, nothing else.
- Three scratch filesystems. The difference between the first two is the next slide.
- Ritom is the third, on VAST, for parallel I/O into a shared file.
- Its cleanup is also 30 days. Say it out loud, because it is not in the documentation
  yet — anyone who checks will not find it there.
- Then two project areas: the store, which is backed up, and datacache, which is not and which you have to ask for.

- Scratch is yours. Per user. Not backed up.
- Store belongs to the project. Shared. Backed up.
- Everything else on this slide hangs off those two.
- If anyone asks about home:
- No cleanup, and there are daily snapshots of the last seven days in $HOME/.snapshot.
- That has saved people who deleted their own code. Worth knowing it exists.
- Tape backups for Home are being implemented, so do not promise them yet.

- This is the column that hurts people.
- Say the mechanism precisely, because it is not what they assume.
- It is not age. It is last access time.
- A file nobody has read for 14 days on iopsstor is deleted. 30 days on capstor.
- So a dataset you keep reading survives. A checkpoint you wrote and forgot does not.
- Not archived. Deleted.
- Ritom's cleanup is 30 days too, but that is not in the documentation yet.
- Next: So which scratch, for what?

<!-- Verified against cscs-docs-preview.svc.cscs.ch/442, both /storage/filesystems/ and
/platforms/mlp/, quoting them directly:
  home     "There is no cleanup policy on Home"; 50 GB and 500,000 inodes; daily
           snapshots of the last seven days in $HOME/.snapshot; tape backups "currently
           being implemented"; retained three months after your last project finishes.
  iopsstor "Files ... that have not been accessed in 14 days are automatically deleted."
  capstor  "Files ... that have not been accessed in 30 days are automatically deleted."
           150 TB, 1 million inodes, soft quota with a two-week grace period.
           "There are no backups on Scratch."
  store    "There is no cleanup policy on Store"; "the three most recent copies of every
           file backed up to tape every 24 hours"; quota from the initial resource
           request; retained three months after the project ends.
  ritom    the preview says the cleanup policy "is being finalised". Per Andrea it is
           30 days, the same as capstor. The slide states 30 days; the documentation
           does not, so it must be said out loud.
Note the criterion is LAST ACCESS, not age or modification time.

TODO(verify): THIS SLIDE'S FOOTER DOES NOT YET BACK IT. docs.cscs.ch/storage/filesystems/
is live but lists only Home, the two Lustre scratches and Store — no ritom, no datacache.
Both exist solely in the /442 preview. Until that merges, anyone who follows the citation
finds a page that does not mention two of the six rows. Re-check on the morning of the
session; if the merge has not happened, say so out loud rather than letting somebody
discover it afterwards. (Ritom itself IS live-documented, but on
docs.cscs.ch/guides/storage/, not on the filesystems page.)

TODO(verify): two things the preview does not settle.
 1. The iopsstor scratch quota is not stated anywhere. Find it, or leave it off.
 2. The preview labels ritom "(Clariden only)" and says "On Clariden, the cleanup policy
    ... is being finalised". Andrea says it is NOT mounted only on Clariden, so the slide
    drops that qualifier. This is a documentation error, not a gap — fix the page. -->

# NVMe for reading data, HDD for writing checkpoints

The three scratch filesystems are built from different hardware. Match the workload.

<div class="cols-3">
<div class="card">

### `iopsstor` — NVMe

Use it for:

- Training and validation datasets read **frequently and non-sequentially**
- **Many small, random** I/O operations

Cleaned after **14 days**.

</div>
<div class="card">

### `capstor` — HDD

Use it for:

- **Model checkpoints**
- Outputs involving **large, contiguous** I/O

Cleaned after **30 days**.

</div>
<div class="card">

### `ritom` — VAST over NFS

Use it for:

- Many ranks writing **one shared file** — collective MPI-IO, parallel HDF5
- Checkpoints from many ranks into **few files**

Little benefit for file-per-rank I/O.

</div>
</div>

<div class="accent">

Nothing on scratch survives. Shared project data goes on the **store** or on **`datacache`** — next two slides.

</div>

<!--
- All three are called scratch. They are different hardware and they behave differently.
- iopsstor is NVMe. It is good at IOPS. Put your dataset there, the thing you read from constantly in random order.
- capstor is spinning disks, optimised for large sequential reads and writes. Put your checkpoints there.
- Get those two backwards and your training is slower for no reason at all.
- Then the third one, because they just saw it in the table.
- Ritom is VAST, over NFS. It is the one for parallel I/O into a shared file.
- Collective MPI-IO, parallel HDF5 or NetCDF, and checkpoints written from many ranks into a small number of files.
- The documentation is clear that file-per-rank I/O sees little benefit there, so it is not a general-purpose replacement for the other two.
- If you do use it, read the tuning settings in the storage guide first — locking, collective buffering, data sieving. VAST behaves differently from Lustre and MPI-IO can get it wrong by default.
- Its cleanup is 30 days, same as capstor. That is not documented yet, so say it rather than letting them look for it.
- Let me read the red bar.
- And when the job finishes, move what you care about to project storage. Say it every time.
- Next: How much have you actually used?

# Project storage is what you asked for in the proposal

`/capstor/store/cscs/swissai/<project>` — the only durable place, and the only backed-up one.

<div class="cols">
<div>

- Quota comes from the **initial resource request**
- Small projects: **1 TB, 1M inodes** by default
- Large projects: **no default** — you state it in the proposal
- **Backed up** to tape: three most recent copies, every 24 hours
- No cleanup policy

</div>
<div class="card">

### At the end

Contents are retained for **three months** after the project finishes.

Home is retained for three months after your **last** project finishes.

</div>
</div>

<div class="accent">

This is why the proposal asks for a data footprint. Storage is not elastic.

</div>

<!--
- Project storage is the only place that is neither small nor temporary.
- The quota is not negotiable after the fact. It is what you asked for in the proposal.
- Small projects get a terabyte by default. Large projects get no default at all, you state it.
- It is backed up to tape, three copies, every 24 hours. Scratch is not.
- And at the end, three months, then it goes.
- That connects back to module 1: this is why we ask for a data footprint up front.
- Next: And from today there is a second project area, which is new.

<span class="tag">New — from 26 August</span>

# `datacache` is fast, shared, and does not disappear

Available from today, after the maintenance. It fills the gap between scratch and project store.

<div class="cols-wide">
<div>

| | Fast? | Survives? | Shared by the project? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scratch `iopsstor` | **yes** | no — 14 days | no, per user |
| Project store | medium | **yes** | **yes** |
| **`datacache`** | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** |

`/iopsstor/datacache/cscs/swissai/<project>`

</div>
<div class="card">

### How to get one

It is **not** provisioned by default.

Your **PI** opens a Service Desk ticket with the use case, and the space and inodes needed. CSCS reviews it before creating the area.

</div>
</div>

<div class="accent">

Project-level like the store, but **not backed up**, like scratch. And nothing is ever deleted for you.

</div>

<!--
- Until today you had two bad options for a dataset the whole team reads.
- Put it on scratch: fast, but it is per user, and it is deleted after 14 days.
- Put it on project store: shared and durable, but it is medium-performance, so random reads are slow.
- So teams kept a copy each, on scratch, and re-staged it every two weeks.
- datacache is the third option. Fast NVMe, shared across the project, and never cleaned automatically.
- One copy of the dataset. The whole project reads it. It is still there next month.
- Look at RED BAR.
- Place it against the model from two slides ago. Scratch is yours and not backed up. Store is the project's and is backed up.
- datacache is the odd one: it belongs to the project, like the store, but it is not backed up, like scratch.
- And unlike both, nothing is ever deleted for you.
- Within your quota on capacity and inodes, the project owns its own space hygiene. That is a real responsibility.

- It is not created by default. Your PI opens a Service Desk ticket saying what it is for and how much space and how many inodes.
- We review it before creating the area.
- Next: Where to read more.

<!-- TODO(verify): THIS SLIDE'S FOOTER DOES NOT YET BACK IT. The live
docs.cscs.ch/platforms/mlp/ does not mention datacache at all.
datacache is documented only on the preview at
cscs-docs-preview.svc.cscs.ch/442/platforms/mlp/ and goes live on 26 August after the
maintenance. Confirm on the morning of the session that it is actually available — if
the maintenance slips, this slide says "from today" and would be wrong on stage.

# Inodes run out before terabytes do

A quota has two numbers, and people only remember one.

<div class="cols">
<div>

- Home is **50 GB** — and **500,000 inodes**
- One inode is roughly one file
- **One PyTorch virtual environment is about 22,800 inodes**
- So about twenty of those and Home is full, on a metric nobody was watching

</div>
<div class="card">

### The fix, and it is the same one as module 3

> "Lustre is not well suited to handling many small files."

Squash the environment into a **single squashfs image**. One file instead of twenty-two thousand.

That is exactly what a **uenv** already is.

</div>
</div>

<div class="accent">

Millions of small training files hurt the metadata servers, not just your quota.

</div>

<!--
- A quota has two numbers and people only remember the gigabytes.
- Space, and inodes. An inode is roughly a file.
- Home gives you 50 gigabytes and five hundred thousand files.
- Now the number that surprises everyone: one PyTorch virtual environment is about
  twenty-two thousand eight hundred inodes.
- So roughly twenty environments and your home directory is full — not on size, on file count.
- The documentation is blunt about why: Lustre is not well suited to handling many small files.
- The fix is on the right, and it is the same trick module 3 will show you.
- Squash the whole environment into one squashfs image. One file, not twenty-two thousand.
- That is literally what a uenv is. Module 3 picks this up.
- Next: Now get the data in.

# Moving data in: Globus from outside, `xfer` from inside

Never move terabytes from a login node.

<div class="cols">
<div>

### From outside CSCS

The recommended route is the **CSCS Globus Online endpoint**. Authenticate with your CSCS credentials.

### Between CSCS filesystems

Submit to the **`xfer`** Slurm partition. Do not do it interactively.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --time=02:00:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --partition=xfer

command="rsync -av"
srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS $command $1 $2
```

</div>
<div class="card">

### `rclone` beats `rsync` at scale

For a directory with many files, or a few very large checkpoints, `rclone` copies in parallel.

**Many files**
`rclone copy --transfers=16 --checkers=32 --progress`

**Large files**
`rclone copy --multi-thread-streams=4 --multi-thread-cutoff=256M --transfers=4 --progress`

**1 TB in about 5 minutes** — roughly 3 GB/s.

</div>
</div>

<!--
- Two directions, two tools.
- From outside CSCS, use Globus. It handles restarts, which matters when the transfer takes hours.
- Between CSCS filesystems, use the xfer partition. It is a Slurm partition dedicated to this.
- The point of xfer is that you are not doing it on a login node, where you would be hurting everybody else.
- On the right, the thing people do not know: rclone is often much faster than rsync, because it works in parallel.
- Two flag sets, one for many small files, one for a few big ones.
- Give them the concrete number: a one terabyte directory from store to scratch takes about five minutes. Roughly three gigabytes a second.
- Start with those values and raise the parallelism gradually, watching the effect on the metadata servers.
- If you need to chain transfers, xfer jobs take --dependency=afterok like any other Slurm job.
- Next: What about data that has to outlive the project?
