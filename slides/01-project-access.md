<span class="tag">Module 1 · 14 min</span>

# Project lifecycle and access

Anna gets a project. Anna adds Ben. Ben logs in. Both watch the budget.

<div class="split">

**First half — PIs and deputies.** Getting a project, the team, the budget.
**Second half — everyone.** Account, MFA, keys, logging in.

</div>

<!--
START AT T+05:00. Check the presenter timer now.
CUT IF LATE: Cut "What this module deliberately skipped", and "What a Swiss AI project comes with" if you must — the inference slide carries the point.
SAY:
- This module is 14 minutes. It is the plumbing part.
- The interesting part of the hour is modules 2 and 3.
TELL THEM WHEN TO PAY ATTENTION. This is the point of this slide:
- The first half is for PIs and deputy PIs. Getting a project, adding people, watching the budget.
- The second half is for everybody who has to log in. Account, MFA, keys, the jump host.
- Each slide says in the top right corner which one it is.
- So if the first half is not your job, you have four minutes to read your email. I will not be offended.
THEN:
- Every command I show is on the handout. So do not type. Just watch.
- Meet Anna. She is a PI with a new project.
- And Ben. He is a PhD student who joins her project.
NEXT: Start at the beginning. How do you get a project at all?

# Small and large are two different processes

You choose which one to apply for. The Swiss AI Initiative decides. CSCS opens the project and runs it.

<div class="cols-wide">
<div>

|  | Small | Large |
|---|---|---|
| Typical budget | up to 32,000 GPUh | 500,000 GPUh and up |
| Duration | 6 months | 12 months |
| Review | rolling | two calls a year |
| Start | first day of the next month | 1 January or 1 July |
| Storage | 1 TB, 1M inodes by default | must be in the proposal |

</div>
<div class="card">

### Before asking for a large one

- A GPU-hour number you **measured**
- The efficiency you expect to reach
- The **data footprint**, and how long it stays

A large proposal can be **cut down to a small grant** rather than rejected.

</div>
</div>

<div class="accent">

The 4th call for large projects is open right now — **3 August to 14 September 2026**. `swiss-ai.org/compute-grants`

</div>

<!--
SAY FIRST, who does what. People ask us for hours and we cannot give them:
- You decide whether to apply for a small or a large project. That choice is yours.
- You apply to the Swiss AI Initiative, not to us. They decide.
- Swiss AI tells us to open the small ones as they are approved, all year round.
- And twice a year they hand us the large ones, together.
- CSCS opens the project and runs it. We do not decide who gets what.
THEN THE TWO KINDS:
- People often apply to the wrong one.
- Small: up to 32,000 GPU hours. Six months. Reviewed all year.
- So you can ask today and start on the first day of next month.
- Large: 500,000 GPU hours and more. Twelve months.
- It starts only on 1 January or 1 July. If you miss a call, you wait six months.
- The storage row is the one people forget.
- Small gets 1 terabyte by default. Large gets no default. You must ask for it in the proposal.
- Bring three things to a large proposal: GPU hours you measured, the efficiency you expect, and your data footprint.
- Good news: a weak large proposal is usually made smaller. It is not simply rejected.
POINT AT THE RED BAR:
- The 4th large call closes on 14 September. That is about three weeks from today.
- If you want a large project in January, this is your call.
NEXT: Say Anna applied and was granted a project. Who is she now, and what is an account?

# Your account lives as long as one project does

An account can belong to several projects. It closes only when the last one closes.

<div class="cols">
<div>

### Three roles in the portal

- **Project administrator** — the PI. Anna.
- **Project manager** — the deputy PI.
- **Project member** — everyone else. Ben.

Administrators and managers **invite people** and **assign roles**.

</div>
<div class="card">

### One account, many projects

- Your **email address** identifies you — one address, one account
- **Institutional addresses only.** Always use the same one
- Open while **at least one** project is open
- An end date stops the **compute**, not the project: **90 days** of grace follow
- A later invitation **re-enables** the same account

</div>

If you are a PI and you have never opened `portal.cscs.ch`, this module is the one to stay awake for.

SAY:
- The portal uses three words. People often guess them wrong.
- Project administrator is the PI. That is Anna.
- Project manager is the deputy PI.
- Project member is everyone else. That is Ben.
- Only the first two can invite people and set roles.
NOW THE IMPORTANT PART. Say it slowly:
- Your account is identified by your email address. One address, one account.
- We only accept institutional addresses. Not a personal one.
- And because the address IS the identity, always use the same one. If you sign up
  again with a different address you get a second account, not access to your old one.
- Your account belongs to projects, and it can belong to several at the same time.
- It stays open while at least one of those projects is open.
- Be precise about the end, because this is the part people get wrong.
- A project's end date stops your compute. That is what you feel first.
- The project itself does not close yet. It stays active for another 90 days so you can get your data out.
- Only after those 90 days does it close. And the account closes with the last of your projects.
- Good news: if someone invites you to a project later, the same account is switched back on.
- People forget this every year. Say it slowly.
NEXT: Anna has a project and a role. Let us open the portal.

<!-- TODO(verify): docs.cscs.ch/accounts/ backs only the middle of this card — "accounts
are bound to projects, and accounts will be closed with the project unless the account
is also part of another open project". The two ends do not appear there: that the email
address is the unique identity, and that a later invitation re-enables the same account
rather than creating a new one. Both come from Andrea as ML Platform service manager.
Confirm, then get them written into the docs page. -->

# Adding Ben takes one email address

One email address, or a CSV for a whole cohort. Either way the invitation carries the role.

### One person

Green **Invite Users** button, enter the email address, assign the role.

# What a Swiss AI project comes with

Compute and storage arrive with the project. One more resource is opt-in.

<div class="cols">
<div>

### By default

- **Compute** on **Clariden** and **Bristen**
- **Storage** — home, scratch, project store

### On request

- **`datacache`** — fast shared storage, by Service Desk ticket
- **Inference** — an API resource the **PI or deputy** adds in the portal

</div>
<div class="card">

### They all draw on one credit

There is no separate inference budget and no separate storage budget you can overspend independently.

It is **one project credit**, and everything spends it.

</div>
</div>

<div class="accent">

The next slide is the one nobody expects: you can use a model without running a job at all.

</div>

<!--
SAY:
- Quick inventory, because people do not know what they already have.
- By default a Swiss AI project comes with compute on both clusters, Clariden and Bristen, and storage.
- Two things are opt-in. A datacache area, which module 2 covers, by Service Desk ticket.
- And an inference resource, which the PI or the deputy adds themselves in the portal.
POINT AT THE CARD:
- The thing to take away is that these are not separate pots.
- One project credit, and all of it spends the same credit.
NEXT: And that last one deserves its own slide.

### It is not free, it is yours

> "The credit for the inference resource is taken from your project's credit."

**There is no project-level cap.** A PI who wants a ceiling on inference has to ask for one by Service Desk ticket.

</div>
</div>

<div class="accent">

The docs also show how to point **Claude Code** and **OpenCode** at it.

</div>

<!--
This one is for a Swiss AI room specifically. Do not rush it.
SAY:
- Last thing, and it does not involve a cluster, a container or Slurm at all.
- There is a managed inference API. Open-weight models, served for you, behind a public endpoint.
- It is OpenAI and Anthropic compatible, so whatever you already wrote works if you change the base URL.
- And it serves Apertus, which is your own model.
- Many of you want to use a model rather than train one. This is that, and until today we were not telling you about it.
HOW YOU GET IT, and note the split:
- The PI or the deputy PI creates an inference resource in the portal. The same portal as module 1.
- After that, any member of the project can create their own API keys.
- Each key can carry its own token budget, a reset period, and a list of allowed models.
- The key is shown once when it is created. Put it in a password manager.
BE HONEST ABOUT THE COST. Read the quotation out loud:
- The credit comes out of the project credit. It is not a free extra.
- So it lands on the same budget as the linear consumption slide.
- And be precise about the limit, because this is what a PI needs to hear.
- Each API key can carry a token budget, but any project member can create another key.
- So a per-key budget does not cap the project. Today there is no project-level cap at all.
- If you want a ceiling on how much of your credit can go to inference, that is a Service Desk ticket.
- Say it as an instruction to the PIs, not as an announcement that the guardrail is missing. But if a PI asks directly, answer directly.
POINT AT THE CURL:
- Three lines. That is the whole thing. Endpoint, bearer token, model name.
- If you have written against the OpenAI API, you have already written this.
POINT AT THE RED BAR:
- And the documentation shows how to wire it into Claude Code and OpenCode, if that is how you work.
NEXT: Where to read more.

Out of credit before the end? The `low` partition, capped at two months of your budget.
All the rules: **docs.cscs.ch/platforms/mlp/**

</div>

<!--
This is the most useful slide for PIs. Do not rush it.
SAY, to frame it first:
- Every project is granted a compute credit, in GPU hours.
- The model is usage based. You spend the credit as your jobs run.
- And you are expected to spend it more or less evenly, month by month.
THEN THE TWO NUMBERS:
- Every month has two numbers.
- Expected: how much you should use this month.
- Minimal: the expected amount minus a grace. The grace is 15 to 50 per cent, depending on how big your budget is.
NOW WALK THROUGH THE THREE BARS, left to right:
- Left bar: you used more than expected. This is fine. You only run at lower priority while you are ahead.
- Middle bar: you used less, but you stayed above the minimal. The rest moves to the next months.
- Right bar: you fell below the minimal. The red box is credit you lost. It does not come back.
THEN THE TIMELINE AT THE BOTTOM:
- The project runs 6 or 12 months.
- At the end date your compute stops. No more jobs.
- But the project does not close. It stays active for another 90 days, for data only.
- After those 90 days it closes for real.
POINT AT THE RED BAR:
- If you run out of credit early, you are not stuck.
- You can still use the low partition. About two months of your budget.
POINT AT THE LINK IN THE RED BAR:
- Every number on this slide is on that one page. Take a photo of it.
NEXT: That is Anna finished. The rest of the module is Ben.
DOCS: docs.cscs.ch/platforms/mlp/policies/
-->

<!-- TODO(verify): every number on this slide — the 15-50% grace, the two-month cap on
the low partition, the 90-day retrieval window — comes from the MLP policies page,
which is still a docs preview at cscs-docs-preview.svc.cscs.ch/463/platforms/mlp/policies/.
Re-check them once it is merged into docs.cscs.ch.
The slide now PRINTS the URL docs.cscs.ch/platforms/mlp/policies/, which does not resolve
yet. Load it in a browser before the session. If it is still not live on 26 August, fall
back to docs.cscs.ch/platforms/mlp/ here and on the "Where to read more" slide — a URL
that 404s on a projector costs more credibility than a less precise one.

Also: the policies page says only that a project "remains accessible for a grace period
of 90 days for data retrieval". That the end date stops COMPUTE while the project itself
stays active comes from Andrea, not from the page. It is the distinction the timeline now
makes, so it is worth getting written down — see notes/docs-gaps.md. -->

- Log in to any CSCS web page. Type the code you get by email. Scan the QR code. Type the six digits.
- Any TOTP app works. We tested Google Authenticator and FreeOTP.
READ THE RED BAR OUT LOUD. It is the exact sentence from the docs:
- This prevents our most common ticket.
- Someone tries SSH, gets "permission denied", and never set up MFA.
NEXT: Ben has an account. Now he needs a key.

# Signed keys expire after one day

Generate the key pair once. Sign it every day. Five signatures per day, maximum.

```bash
brew install eth-cscs/tap/cscs-key       # macOS, Linux — or download the release binary
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/cscs-key # once, ever
cscs-key sign                            # every day: signs ~/.ssh/cscs-key
ssh-add -t 1d ~/.ssh/cscs-key            # load it into the agent
```

<div class="cols">
<div>

- Keys are valid for **1 day** by default
- You can create up to **5 keys per day**
- `cscs-key list` and `cscs-key revoke` if something leaks

</div>
<div class="card">

### No CLI? Use the dashboard

`user-account.cscs.ch` → SSH Keys → Sign Key. Paste the public key, download the certificate.

</div>
</div>

<!--
People take a photo of this slide. Pause here.
SAY, one line per command:
- Install cscs-key. One time.
- Create the key pair. One time. Only once, ever.
- Sign it. This is the daily step.
- Load it into the agent.
THEN THE RULES:
- A signed key lasts one day.
- You can sign five keys per day. That is enough for normal work.
- If a key leaks, use cscs-key list and cscs-key revoke.
- Cannot install the CLI on your machine? Use the web page. Same result.
- All of this is on the handout. Nobody needs to type now.
NEXT: Ben has a signed key. Where does he send it?

# Everything goes through ela.cscs.ch

Ela is the jump host. You never connect to Clariden or Bristen directly.

<div class="cols">
<div>

```
Host ela
    HostName ela.cscs.ch
    User cscsusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cscs-key

Host clariden
    HostName clariden.alps.cscs.ch
    User cscsusername
    ProxyJump ela
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/cscs-key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

</div>
<div class="stack">
<div class="card">

### Then it is just

`ssh clariden` — add `-A` to forward your agent.

</div>
<div class="card">

### Bristen needs its own block

Copy the `clariden` block, change the alias and `HostName`. Ela is shared.

</div>
<div class="card code-sm">

### Tunnel to a compute node

```bash
ssh -N \
  -J ${MYUSER}@ela.cscs.ch,${MYUSER}@${CLUSTER}.alps.cscs.ch \
  -L ${PORT}:localhost:${PORT} ${MYUSER}@${NODE}
```

</div>
</div>
</div>

<!--
SAY:
- Write this in your SSH config one time. Then you never think about the jump host again.
- Two entries. Ela. And the cluster behind it, with ProxyJump.
- Replace cscsusername with your real username.
- After that you just type: ssh clariden.
BE VERY CLEAR HERE. People get this wrong:
- Bristen is not a hostname you swap in.
- It is a second Host block of its own. The Ela entry stays shared.
- Clariden is for production runs. Bristen is for test and development, best effort.
LAST BOX:
- This is the question we get at every drop-in. How do I reach a dashboard or a notebook on a compute node?
- That is the tunnel. It is on the handout and in the docs.
- Do not explain it here. There is no time.
NEXT: Ben is in. Two things I am not covering.

# What this module deliberately skipped

<div class="cols">
<div>

- **Password and MFA troubleshooting** — service desk, they are fast
- **Legacy key management** — `sshservice.cscs.ch` was retired in May 2026

</div>
<div>

- **Service accounts** — for pipelines. Scoped to one project, grant access to all its resources. The **PI** requests one by Service Desk ticket
- **The HPC Console** — a pointer only, see module 4
- **Everything you do once you are in** — modules 2 and 3

</div>
</div>

<div class="accent">

You now have an account, a project and a shell. The rest of the hour is what you do with them.

</div>

<!--
One line each. Ten seconds in total. Do not start a discussion here.
SAY:
- Password and MFA problems: write to the service desk. They are fast.
- The old SSH service was switched off in May 2026. Some people still have it in their notes. Say the date out loud.
- Service accounts exist. They are for pipelines. One service account belongs to one project.
- The PI asks for one with a Service Desk ticket. It is not a self-service button.
- The HPC Console: only a pointer here. Module 4 shows it.
- If anyone asks about Kubernetes: it exists at CSCS but the documentation says it is only for specific partners and is not available for normal users on Alps. Do not promise it.
READ THE RED BAR:
- You now have an account, a project and a shell.
NEXT, hand over to module 2:
- Ben has a shell on Clariden and an empty home directory.
- His first question is where to put two terabytes of training data.

### Getting a project

- **MLP project policies** — docs.cscs.ch/platforms/mlp/policies/
- **Applying** — swiss-ai.org/compute-grants
- **Accounts, projects and the portal** — docs.cscs.ch/accounts/

### Getting in

- **Creating an account** — docs.cscs.ch/accounts/account-create/
- **MFA** — docs.cscs.ch/access/mfa/
- **SSH, key signing, Ela** — docs.cscs.ch/access/ssh/

</div>
<div class="card dark">

### Keep these three

- `portal.cscs.ch` — the project
- `user-account.cscs.ch` — the account and the keys
- `docs.cscs.ch` — everything else

### Stuck?

- **service-desk@cscs.ch**
- The handout has every command from this module

</div>
</div>

<!--
Do not read this slide out loud.
SAY only this:
- Three addresses to remember.
- portal.cscs.ch for your project.
- user-account.cscs.ch for your account and your keys.
- docs.cscs.ch for everything else.
- And the service desk when none of those help.
- Everything on this slide is also on the handout.
NEXT: hand over to module 2 immediately. We are on the clock.
