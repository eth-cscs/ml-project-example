# The HPC Console

A browser interface to the cluster, built on FirecREST. Open source as `firecrest-ui`.

<!--
- Five more minutes on the HPC Console, since you asked. You saw one slide on it earlier.
- Short version: it is a web interface to the cluster. It does not replace SSH. It complements it.
- Next: Why it exists.

# Not everything needs a terminal

HPC systems are powerful, but not always easily accessible.

<div class="cols">
<div>

- Most access is through **command-line tools** like SSH
- They give flexibility and full control, and they are essential for automation
- They are **not equally usable by everyone**
- Entry-level users face a steep learning curve, even for simple tasks
- Checking system status, finding a job, reading a log: none of it needs full shell expertise

</div>
<div class="card">

### The goal

**Not** to replace SSH.

To provide a complementary tool that simplifies the common operations, and to let AI and ML users get at HPC resources without a week of Slurm first.

</div>
</div>

<!--
- The honest framing first, because this room contains people who love their terminal.
- The goal is not to replace SSH. SSH stays, and for automation it is still the right answer.
- But a lot of daily operations do not need a shell. Is the cluster healthy. What is my job doing. Why did it fail.
- Those are the things people currently do with three tools and six commands.
- Next: What it is built on.

# Built on FirecREST, so it needs nothing on the cluster

`console.mlp.cscs.ch`

<div class="cols">
<div>

### Design principles

- **API-first**, on top of FirecREST
- **Single sign-on** — the same login as everything else
- **No privileged agents** on the HPC systems
- Authentication and session handling stay in the **backend**, never in the browser
- Works across different clusters and schedulers

</div>
<div class="card">

### Why that matters to you

Nothing to install. Nothing running as you on the cluster.

It is the same FirecREST API from module 3 — anything the console does, your own script can do too.

</div>
</div>

<!--
- It is built on the FirecREST API we saw in module 4. That has two consequences worth stating.
- One, there is no privileged agent running on the cluster. The console has no special powers.
- Two, and this is the useful part: anything the console can do, your own script can do, because it is the same API.
- Single sign-on, so it is the same login as the portal and Jupyter.
- Next: What you can actually do with it.

# Four things it does well

<div class="cols">
<div>

### Dashboard

Real-time **cluster health**. Spot a degraded service *before* you submit — the system can prevent execution on unhealthy clusters.

### Scheduler

List and filter your jobs, or all jobs on the account. Submit and configure new ones.

</div>
<div>

### Monitoring

Inspect job scripts, logs and status. Each job has a **shareable URL** — send a colleague the failing job, not a screenshot.

### Filesystem

Browse, manage and preview files. Large uploads.

</div>
</div>

<div class="accent">

The shareable per-job URL is the feature people keep. External dashboards such as Grafana can be integrated.

</div>

<!--
- Four workflows.
- The dashboard shows cluster health in real time, and it will stop you submitting to a degraded cluster. That alone saves a failed overnight run.
- The scheduler view lists your jobs, or everything on the account, with filters.
- Monitoring: job script, logs, status. And the thing I would highlight — every job has its own URL you can send to someone.
- That replaces the screenshot-in-Slack workflow, which is how most debugging conversations start today.
- And a filesystem browser with preview and large upload.
- Next: Where to find it.

# The HPC Console — where to read more

<div class="cols">
<div>

### Use it

- **ML Platform console** — console.mlp.cscs.ch
- HPC Platform — console.hpcp.cscs.ch
- C&W Platform — console.cwp.cscs.ch

### Underneath

- **FirecREST** — docs.cscs.ch/access/firecrest/
- **FirecREST v2** — eth-cscs.github.io/firecrest-v2/

</div>
<div class="card dark">

### The one-line version

It is a browser you can point at the cluster, it needs nothing installed, and it is the same API your scripts can call.

Open source as **`firecrest-ui`**.

</div>
</div>

<!--
- One URL per platform. Yours is console dot mlp.
- It is open source as firecrest-ui, so if your institution wants its own, that is possible.
- Next: back to the discussion.
